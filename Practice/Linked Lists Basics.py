# # Types of Linked Lists
# 
# In this notebook we'll explore three versions of linked-lists: singly-linked lists, doubly-linked lists, and circular lists.
# 
# ## Singly Linked Lists
# 
# In this linked list, each node in the list is connected only to the next node in the list. 
# 
# ![Singly Linked List](assets/singly_linked_list.png)
# 
# This connection is typically implemented by setting the `next` attribute on a node object itself.

# In[ ]:


class Node:
    def __init__(self, value):
        self.value = value
        self.next = None


# In[ ]:


# A small linked list:

head = Node(1)
head.next = Node(2)


# Above we have a simple linked list with two elements, `[1, 2]`. Usually you'll want to create a `LinkedList` class as a wrapper for the nodes themselves and to provide common methods that operate on the list. For example you can implement an `append` method that adds a value to the end of the list. Note that if we're only tracking the head of the list, this runs in linear time - $O(N)$ - since you have to iterate through the entire list to get to the tail node. However, prepending (adding to the head of the list) can be done in constant $O(1)$ time. You'll implement this `prepend` method in the Linked List Practice notebook.

# In[ ]:


class LinkedList:
    def __init__(self):
        self.head = None
        
    def append(self, value):
        if self.head is None:
            self.head = Node(value)
            return
        
        # Move to the tail (the last node)
        node = self.head
        while node.next:
            node = node.next
        
        node.next = Node(value)
        return


# In[ ]:


linked_list = LinkedList()
linked_list.append(1)
linked_list.append(2)
linked_list.append(4)

node = linked_list.head
while node:
    print(node.value)
    node = node.next


# >**Exercise:** Add a method `to_list()` to `LinkedList` that converts a linked list back into a Python list.

# In[ ]:


class LinkedList:
    def __init__(self):
        self.head = None
        
    def append(self, value):
        if self.head is None:
            self.head = Node(value)
            return
        
        # Move to the tail (the last node)
        node = self.head
        while node.next:
            node = node.next
        
        node.next = Node(value)
        return
    
    def to_list(self):
        
        # TODO: Write function to turn Linked List into Python List
        
        pass


# In[ ]:


# Test your method here
linked_list = LinkedList()
linked_list.append(3)
linked_list.append(2)
linked_list.append(-1)
linked_list.append(0.2)

print ("Pass" if  (linked_list.to_list() == [3, 2, -1, 0.2]) else "Fail")

# ## Doubly Linked Lists
# 
# This type of list has connections backwards and forwards through the list.
# 
# ![Doubly Linked List](assets/doubly_linked_list.png)

# In[ ]:


class DoubleNode:
    def __init__(self, value):
        self.value = value
        self.next = None
        self.previous = None


# Now that we have backwards connections it makes sense to track the tail of the linked list as well as the head.
# 
# >**Exercise:** Implement a doubly linked list that can append to the tail in constant time. Make sure to include forward and backward connections when adding a new node to the list.

# In[ ]:


class DoublyLinkedList:
    def __init__(self):
        self.head = None
        self.tail = None
    
    def append(self, value):
        
        # TODO: Implement this method to append to the tail of the list
        
        pass


# In[ ]:


# Test your class here

linked_list = DoublyLinkedList()
linked_list.append(1)
linked_list.append(-2)
linked_list.append(4)

print("Going forward through the list, should print 1, -2, 4")
node = linked_list.head
while node:
    print(node.value)
    node = node.next

print("\nGoing backward through the list, should print 4, -2, 1")
node = linked_list.tail
while node:
    print(node.value)
    node = node.previous

# ## Circular Linked Lists
# 
# Circular linked lists occur when the chain of nodes links back to itself somewhere. For example `NodeA -> NodeB -> NodeC -> NodeD -> NodeB` is a circular list because `NodeD` points back to `NodeB` creating a loop `NodeB -> NodeC -> NodeD -> NodeB`. 
# 
# ![Circular Linked List](assets/circular_linked_list.png)
# 
# A circular linked list is typically considered pathological because when you try to iterate through it, you'll never find the end. We usually want to detect if there is a loop in our linked lists to avoid these problems. You'll get a chance to implement a solution for detecting loops later in the lesson.
