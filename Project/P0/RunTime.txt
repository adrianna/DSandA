Task0.py RunTime: O(1)
-----------------------
Retrieval of element in ordered list given known index is a one-time transaction.
Therefore, the worst case Big O is a constant, O(1)


Task1.py RunTime: O(n)
-----------------------
Deleting duplicates required traversing the array and populating a hash-key counter
of every number encountered. If it exists in the hash key, the value is incremented by
one. Each conditional statement is a check to see if the hash exists and if not,
enter the key of the phone number and assign 1 as the first and only number found.
This operation is O(1).

For each entry, the conditional statements is executed. If the condition is true, the
instruction is executed. This is done for a total of n lines in the call list.

The algorithm takes O(n*(1 + 1)). It goes through two if-elsif-else blocks, one for
outgoing_calls check, the other for incoming_calls check. Therefore, two of
six instructions will be executed.

The algorithm time reduces to O(2*n). Since the coefficient is constant, the equation
is simplified to O(n).


Task2.py RunTime: O(n)
-----------------------
The maxCallDuration entails a for loop of n-lines in the calls file. For each line
item, it parses the date and month which are O(1) operation. It then does check on
the month of interest, i.e. September, to execute another set of conditional
statements that would track the max duration in calls. The if statements are O(1)
operation. Therefore, if we add 

O(n) = O(n) [for loop]  + O(1) parse duration + O(1) date + O(1) month + O(1) call_hash update
O(n) ~ O(n) + 4O(1) 

The call_hash tracks the phone call (regardless if it's incoming or not), then adds the
duration time. When the next line loops and it sees this phone number in the hash, it
will update with the new duration time.

The goal is to track and add duration times to each phone number, whether it is receiving a call 
or placing a call. The last two lines will do an O(n) to find the maximum and another O(n) in the 
lambda code to find the key-value pair of the phone call that has maximum call time.

Therefore, the sum total of order of operation: 
O(n) =  O(n) for loop + O(n) (max call_time value) + O(n) (finding phone call key to max call_time value) 
O(n) = 3O(n)
O(n) ~ O(n)


Task3.py RunTime: O(n)
-----------------------
The algorithm does a one-time parse of the call logs for both questions. The for loop
will complete n times, given n the number of phone line items in the calls log.
For each call item, the operations that follow are conditional statements or hash key
lookup, which are of constant O(1). For example, in parsePhoneCallsType(), for each
call line item, the algorithm:
* parses the line: O(1)
* executes one of three conditional statements, if any one of the conditional
  statements is executed, the instruction is O(1) type operation. For example,
  instantiating a hash-key, or incrementing a hash counter: both are O(1) operation.
* these three conditional statements called phoneTophone() routine to parse the type
  call made between two phone numbers. This subroutine was all conditional statements
  to construct the right key to identify the phone-to-phone type. Thos statements are
  O(1) operation.
* also executes several conditional statements for parsing out Bangalore outgoing
  calls. As it goes through BangaloreCalls() routine, it executes 2 instructions per
  conditional block (with two nested if statements). This is also O(1) operation.
* the routine returns two hash keys which correspond to the solution of the problem's
  questions.

For the result, the number of unique calls can be calculated either: 
* having a counter for when the hash is created or a key is inputted first time into the hash, OR 
* subtracting total calls *2 (two calls per line) from num_duplicates variable to yield total
  number of unique phone numbers. 
Both method result in the same value.


Task4.py RunTime: O(nlog[n])
--------------------------
In createHash(), the for loops through the max number of either calls or text. As it
loops n times for n-lines in the calls/texts file, it creates specific hash-key
data on outgoing/incoming texts as well as outgoing/incoming calls. It also tracks
known telemarket calls in it own hash-key data structure. All these operations are
O(1) type instruments. However it is executed n-times or corresponding to n-lines in
either calls or text file.

The next for loop iterates through the outgoing calls hash and checks for
telemarketers codes other than the one given from the problem. The number of outgoing
calls will contain unique number of outgoing phone numbers. However, the loop will
iterate ~ n times, assuming there are duplicate or multiple outgoing calls of the same
number.

Since these for loops are done serially. The order of operation would be
O(n) for the first for-loop and O(n) for the second for-each-key-in-hash loop.
Therefore, it is:
	   O(n) + O(n) = 2O(n) ~ O(n)
	   
However, when printing the output of the telemarketers phone numbers, the print statement 
uses a function sorted(hash.keys) which in Python produces a copy of an ordered hash-key list.
This will have a O(m*log[m]), where m is the number of keys in the hash dictionary. (Wiki
page indicates Python uses a Timsort which is O(n*log[n]). Since m < n, because we're looking 
at subsets of phone numbers, then the total 

         O(n) + O(n) + O(m) + O(mlog[m])  ~ 2*O(n) + m*O(log[m] + 1)
        |- 1st for -|  |--- 2nd for --|   ~ O(n) + O(mlog[m])
 					  ~ O(nlog[n])     # For worst case m = n, indicating
					                   # if all the numbers are telemarketer
			                  		   
sorted() operation on the hash.keys() dictionary executed once in the for statement and the
copy of the hash dictionary was used in acquiring the lexicographic order of the keys.
The for loop will just take a total time ~  O(m) + O(mlog[m]).
