# # Binary search practice
# 
# Let's get some practice doing binary search on an array of integers. We'll solve the problem two different waysâ€”
# both iteratively and resursively.
# 
# Here is a reminder of how the algorithm works:
# 
# 1. Find the center of the list (try setting an upper and lower bound to find the center)
# 2. Check to see if the element at the center is your target.
# 3. If it is, return the index.
# 4. If not, is the target greater or less than that element?
# 5. If greater, move the lower bound to just above the current center
# 6. If less, move the upper bound to just below the current center
# 7. Repeat steps 1-6 until you find the target or until the bounds are the same or cross (the upper bound is less
#    than the lower bound).
# 
# 
# ## Problem statement:
# Given a sorted array of integers, and a target value, find the index of the target value in the array. If the
# target value is not present in the array, return -1.
# 

# ## Recursive solution

def binary_search_recursive_soln(array, target, start_index, end_index):
    if start_index > end_index:
        return -1
    
    mid_index = (start_index + end_index)//2
    mid_element = array[mid_index]
    
    if mid_element == target:
        return mid_index
    elif target < mid_element:
        return binary_search_recursive_soln(array, target, start_index, mid_index - 1)
    else:
        return binary_search_recursive_soln(array, target, mid_index + 1, end_index)
        



def test_function(test_case):
    answer = binary_search_recursive(test_case[0], test_case[1])
    if answer == test_case[2]:
        print("Pass!")
    else:
        print("Fail!")


##  Test

array = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
target = 4
index = 4
test_case = [array, target, index]
test_function(test_case)
