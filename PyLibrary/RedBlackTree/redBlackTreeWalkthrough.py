# # Building a Red-Black Tree

# In this notebook, we'll walk through how you might build a red-black tree. Remember, we need to follow
# the red-black tree rules, on top of the binary search tree rules. Our new rules are:
# 
# * All nodes have a color
# * All nodes have two children (use NULL nodes)
#   * All NULL nodes are colored black
# * If a node is red, its children must be black
# * The root node must be black (optional)
#   * We'll go ahead and implement without this for now
# * Every path to its descendant NULL nodes must contain the same number of black nodes


# Similar to our binary search tree implementation, we will define a class for nodes and a class for the tree itself.
# The `Node` class will need a couple new attributes. It is no longer enough to only know the children, because we
# need to ask questions during insertion like, "what color is my parent's sibling?". So we will add a parent link as
# well as the color.

class Node(object):
    def __init__(self, value, parent, color):
        self.value = value
        self.left = None
        self.right = None
        self.parent = parent
        self.color = color


# For the tree, we can start with a mostly empty implementation. But we know we want to always insert nodes with
# color red, so let's fill in the constructor to insert the root node.


class RedBlackTree(object):
    def __init__(self, root):
        self.root = Node(root, None, 'red')
    
    def insert(self, new_val):
        pass
    
    def search(self, find_val):
        return False


# ### Insertion
# 
# Now how would we design our `insert` implementation? We know from our experience with BSTs how most of it will work. We can re-use that portion and augment it to assign colors and parents.

class RedBlackTree(object):
    def __init__(self, root):
        self.root = Node(root, None, 'red')
        
    def insert(self, new_val):
        self.insert_helper(self.root, new_val)

    def insert_helper(self, current, new_val):
        if current.value < new_val:
            if current.right:
                self.insert_helper(current.right, current, new_val)
            else:
                current.right = Node(new_val, current, 'red')
        else:
            if current.left:
                self.insert_helper(current.left, current, new_val)
            else:
                current.left = Node(new_val, current, 'red')


# ### Rotations
# 
# At this point we are only making a BST, with extra attributes. To make this a red-black tree, we need to add the
# extra sauce that makes red-black trees awesome. We will sketch out some more code for rebalancing the tree based on the case, and fill them in one at a
# time.
# 
# First, we need to change our `insert_helper` to return the node that was inserted so we can interrogate it when rebalancing.

class RedBlackTree(object):
    def __init__(self, root):
        self.root = Node(root, None, 'red')
        
    def insert(self, new_val):
        new_node = self.insert_helper(self.root, new_val)
        self.rebalance(new_node)

    def insert_helper(self, current, new_val):
        if current.value < new_val:
            if current.right:
                return self.insert_helper(current.right, new_val)
            else:
                current.right = Node(new_val, current, 'red')
                return current.right
        else:
            if current.left:
                return self.insert_helper(current.left, new_val)
            else:
                current.left = Node(new_val, current, 'red')
                return current.left
    
    def rebalance(self, node):
        pass


# #### Case 1
# 
# _We have just inserted the root node_
# 
# If we're enforcing that the root must be black, we change its color. We are not enforcing this, so we are all done!
# Four to go.



def rebalance(node):
    if node.parent == None:
        return


# #### Case 2
# 
# _We inserted under a black parent node_
# 
# Thinking through this, we can observe the following: We inserted a red node beneath a black node. The new children
# (the NULL nodes) are black by definition, and our red node _replaced_ a black NULL node. So the number of
# black nodes for any paths from parents is unchanged. Nothing to do in this case, either.

def rebalance(node):    
    # Case 1
    if node.parent == None:
        return
    # Case 2
    if node.parent.color == 'black':
        return


# #### Case 3
# 
# _The parent and its sibling of the newly inserted node are both red_
# 
# Okay, we're done with free cases. In this specific case, we can flip the color of the parent and its sibling. We
# know they're both red in this case, which means the grandparent is black. It will also need to flip. At that
# point we will have a freshly painted red node at the grandparent. At that point, we need to do the same evaluation!
# If the grandparent turns red, and its sibling is also red, that's case 3 again. Guess what that means! Time for more recursion.
# 
# We will define the `grandparent` and `pibling` (a parent's sibling) methods later, for now let's focus on the core logic.


def rebalance(self, node):    
    # Case 1
    if node.parent == None:
        return
    # Case 2
    if node.parent.color == 'black':
        return
    # From here, we know parent's color is red
    # Case 3
    if pibling(node).color == 'red':
        pibling(node).color = 'black'
        node.parent.color = 'black'
        grandparent(node).color = 'red'
        self.rebalance(grandparent(node))


# #### Case 4
# 
# _The newly inserted node has a red parent, but that parent has a black sibling_
# 
# These last cases get more interesting. The criteria above actually govern case 4 and 5. What separates them is
# if the newly inserted node is on the _inside_ or the _outside_ of the sub tree. We define _inside_ and _outside_
# like this:
# 
# * inside
#   * _EITHER_
#      * the new node is a left child of its parent, but its parent is a right child, or
#      * the new node is a right child of its parent, but its parent is a left child
# * outside
#   * the opposite of inside, the new node and its parent are on the same side of the grandparent
#   
# Case 4 is to handle the _inside_ scenario. In this case, we need to rotate. As we will see, this will not
# finish balancing the tree, but will now qualify for Case 5.
# 
# We rotate against the inside-ness of the new node. If the new node qualifies for case 4, it needs to move into its
# parent's spot. If it's on the right of the parent, that's a rotate left. If it's on the left of the parent,
# that's a rotate right.

def rebalance(self, node):    
    # ... omitted cases 1-3 ...
    # Case 4
    gp = grandparent(node)
    if gp.left and node == gp.left.right:
        self.rotate_left(parent(node))
    elif gp.right and node == gp.right.left:
        self.rotate_right(parent(node))
    # TODO: Case 5


# To implement `rotate_left` and `rotate_right`, think about what we want to accomplish. We want to take one of
# the node's children and have it take the place of its parent. The given node will move down to a child of the
# newly parental node.

def rotate_left(self, node):
    # Save off the parent of the sub-tree we're rotating
    p = node.parent

    node_moving_up = node.right
    # After 'node' moves up, the right child will now be a left child
    node.right = node_moving_up.left
    
    # 'node' moves down, to being a left child
    node_moving_up.left = node
    node.parent = node_moving_up
    
    # Now we need to connect to the sub-tree's parent
    # 'node' may have been the root
    if p != None:
        if node == p.left:
            p.left = node_moving_up
        else:
            p.right = node_moving_up
    node_moving_up.parent = p

def rotate_right(self, node):
    p = node.parent

    node_moving_up = node.left
    node.left = node_moving_up.right
    
    node_moving_up.right = node
    node.parent = node_moving_up
    
    # Now we need to connect to the sub-tree's parent
    if p != None:
        if node == p.left:
            p.left = node_moving_up
        else:
            p.right = node_moving_up
    node_moving_up.parent = p
    


# #### Case 5
# 
# Now that case 4 is resolved, or if we didn't qualify for case 4 and have an outside sub-tree already, we need to rotate again. If our new node is a left child of a left child, we rotate right. If our new node is a right of a right, we rotate left. This is done on the grandparent node.
# 
# But after this rotation, our colors will be off. Remember that for cases 3, 4, and 5, the parent of the new node is red. But we will have rotated a red node with a red child up, which violates our rule of all red nodes having two black children. So after rotating, we switch the colors of the (original) parent and grandparent nodes.

# ### Testing
# 
# We've written a lot of code. Let's see how the tree mutates as we add nodes.
# 
# First, we'll need a way to visualize the tree. The below will nest, but remember the first child is
# always the left child.

def print_tree(node, level=0):
    print('   ' * (level - 1) + '+--' * (level > 0) + '%s' % node)
    if node.left:
        print_tree(node.left, level + 1)
    if node.right:
        print_tree(node.right, level + 1)


# For cases 1 and 2, we can insert the first few nodes and see the tree behaves the same as a BST.

tree = RedBlackTree(9)
tree.insert(6)
tree.insert(19)

print_tree(tree.root)


# Inserting 13 should flip 6 and 19 to black, as it hits our Case 3 logic.

tree.insert(13)
print_tree(tree.root)


# Observe that 13 was inserted as red, and then because of Case 3, 6 and 19 flipped to black. 9 was also
# assigned red, but that was not a net change. Because we're not enforcing the optional "root is
# always black rule", this is acceptable.
# 
# Now let's cause some rotations. When we insert 16, it goes under 13, but 13 does not have a red sibling.
# 16 rotates into 13's spot, because it's currently an _inside_ sub-tree. Then 16 rotates into 19's spot. After
# these rotations, the ordering of the BST has been preserved _and_ our tree is balanced.

tree.insert(16)
print_tree(tree.root)


# # 👏👏👏👏👏
# 
# You've done it! Go ahead and pat yourself on the back! This is a complex use of a data structure that has significant power.
# It uses _O(n)_ space and insertions and search perform in _O(log n)_ time.

# ## Further Exercises
# 
# To continue exploring our red-black tree implementation, you might try the following.
# * Observe that our current implementation will add duplicates of the same value. Is that desirable? How would you expect
#   that to behave? Change the implementation to mark how many times the same value has been inserted.
# * Implement search and see how it remains logarithmic for large data sets
# * Tinker with the rotations and early escapes to see how they break (use `print_tree`)
# * Consider adding deletion or sketching out how it should work
