## blockchain.py
This program implements single linked list but with the head pointing to the
most recent added Block Node. The tail points to the oldest Block Node.

To append, we add to the head node in O(1). When we want to print the node
to a particular index, we traverse the BlockChain starting at the tail. This
take O(n) to get to the nth node


## LRU Cache
This program updates the cache with value. It uses a hash key to store
the array list. To get O(1) operation on the add or remove, the array
is a doubly linked list.
