        # bonus points if a path works with and without a trailing slash
        # e.g. /about and /about/ both return the /about handler

        # you need to split the path into parts for 
        # both the add_handler and loopup functions,
        # so it should be placed in a function here

# create the router and add a route
router = Router("root handler", "not found handler") # remove the 'not found handler' if you did not implement this
router.add_handler("/home/about", "about handler")  # add a route

# some lookups with the expected output
print(router.lookup("/")) # should print 'root handler'
print(router.lookup("/home")) # should print 'not found handler' or None if you did not implement one
print(router.lookup("/home/about")) # should print 'about handler'
print(router.lookup("/home/about/")) # should print 'about handler' or None if you did not handle trailing slashes
print(router.lookup("/home/about/me")) # should print 'not found handler' or None if you did not implement one
