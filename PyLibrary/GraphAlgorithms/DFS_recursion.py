# # Graph Depth-First Search With Recursion

# We've done depth-first search previously using an iterative approach (i.e., using a loop).
# In this notebook, we'll show how to implement a recursive soluton.
# 
# The basic idea is to select a node and explore all the possible paths from that node, and
# to apply this recursively to each node we are exploring.
# 
# You can see some helpful illustrations with various combinations here:
# https://www.cs.usfca.edu/~galles/visualization/DFS.html

# For this exercise we will be using an Adjacency List representation to store the graph.

# Class Node representation.
class Node:
    def __init__(self,val):
        self.value = val
        self.children = []
        
    def add_child(self,new_node):
        self.children.append(new_node)
    
    def remove_child(self,del_node):
        if del_node in self.children:
            self.children.remove(del_node)

class Graph():
    def __init__(self,node_list):
        self.nodes = node_list
        
    def add_edge(self,node1,node2):
        if(node1 in self.nodes and node2 in self.nodes):
            node1.add_child(node2)
            node2.add_child(node1)
            
    def remove_edge(self,node1,node2):
        if(node1 in self.nodes and node2 in self.nodes):
            node1.remove_child(node2)
            node2.remove_child(node1)


# ### Initializing Graph with an example

# Creating a graph as above.
nodeG = Node('G')
nodeR = Node('R')
nodeA = Node('A')
nodeP = Node('P')
nodeH = Node('H')
nodeS = Node('S')

graph1 = Graph([nodeS,nodeH,nodeG,nodeP,nodeR,nodeA] ) 

graph1.add_edge(nodeG,nodeR)
graph1.add_edge(nodeA,nodeR)
graph1.add_edge(nodeA,nodeG)
graph1.add_edge(nodeR,nodeP)
graph1.add_edge(nodeH,nodeG)
graph1.add_edge(nodeH,nodeP)
graph1.add_edge(nodeS,nodeR)

# To verify that the graph is created accurately.
# Let's just print all the parent nodes and child nodes.
for each in graph1.nodes:
    print('parent node = ',each.value,end='\nchildren\n')
    for each in each.children:
        print(each.value,end=' ')
    print('\n')


# ### Sample input and output 
# 
# The output would vary based on the implementation of your algorithm, the order in which
# children are stored within the adjacency list.

# ### DFS using recursion
# Now that we have our example graph initialized, we are ready to do the actual depth-first
# search. Here's what that looks like:

def dfs_recursion_start(self, start_node):
    visited = {}
    self.dfs_recursion(start_node, visited)

def dfs_recursion(self, node,visited):
    
    if(node == None):
        return False
    
    visited[node.value] = True
    print(node.value)
    
    for each in node.children:
        if( each.value not in visited ):
            self.dfs_recursion(each,visited)


Graph.dfs_recursion_start = dfs_recursion_start

Graph.dfs_recursion = dfs_recursion

graph1.dfs_recursion_start(nodeG)
